# This pipeline contains a basic build and release stage

trigger:
  # Triggers the pipeline when a commit is pushed to the main branch
  - main

# Defines the stages for the pipeline

# This YAML pipeline defines two stages: a Build stage and a Release stage. The Build stage contains a single job, which builds the application, runs unit tests, and publishes the artifacts to Azure DevOps. 
stages:
  - stage: Build
    displayName: Build stage
    jobs:
      - job: BuildJob
        displayName: Build job
        pool:
          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
        steps:
          - script: echo Building the application...
            displayName: Build application
          - script: echo Running unit tests...
            displayName: Unit tests
          - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
            inputs:
              pathtoPublish: '$(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)'
              artifactName: 'myApplication'
              publishLocation: 'Container'

#The Release stage depends on the Build stage and contains a single job, which deploys the application, runs integration tests, and uses the AzureWebApp task to deploy the application to an Azure Web App.

  - stage: Release
    displayName: Release stage
    dependsOn: Build
    jobs:
      - job: ReleaseJob
        displayName: Release job
        pool:
          vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
        steps:
          - script: echo Deploying the application...
            displayName: Deploy application
          - script: echo Running integration tests...
            displayName: Integration tests
          - task: AzureWebApp@1
            inputs:
              azureSubscription: 'My Azure Subscription'
              appName: 'my-app'
              package: '$(Pipeline.Workspace)/drop/myApplication.zip'
              appSettings: '-ConnectionStrings:MyDb=MyConnectionString'

# Note that you will need to update the pipeline with your specific details, such as your Azure subscription and web app name. Also, this is just a basic example to give you an idea of what a YAML pipeline for CI/CD might look like in Azure DevOps. You can customize the pipeline to fit your specific needs and requirements.
